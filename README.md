# AI Games

This repository represents my attempts to replicate different AI algorithms to solve multiplayer zero-sum games. The `core/` folder contains the differnt classes that are used throughout the code such as `Game` and `Agent`. The `games/` folder is a collection of games that are subclassed from `Game`. Finally the `agents/` folder contains all the trained agents.
